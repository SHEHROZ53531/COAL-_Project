# COAL-_Project
This project is a simple Hotel Management System implemented in Assembly Language using the EMU 8086 processor. The system allows users to interactively choose from a menu of food options available in a fictional hotel restaurant, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.

**Features**
Menu Display: Users can view different menus for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.
Order Processing: Users can select items from the menu and specify the quantity, with the system calculating the total price.
User Interaction: The program provides a simple command-line interface for user input and feedback.
File Structure
Main.asm: The main source code file containing the Assembly Language implementation of the Hotel Management System.
**How to Run**
Set Up EMU 8086: Make sure you have the EMU 8086 emulator installed on your machine.
Load the Code: Open the Main.asm file in the EMU 8086 environment.
Assemble and Run: Assemble the code and run the program to interact with the Hotel Management System.
**Usage**
Upon running the program, the user will see the main menu with options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.
The user can select an option by entering the corresponding number.
The system will display the available items for the selected menu, allowing the user to make an order.
After placing an order, the total price will be displayed, along with an option to return to the main menu or exit the program.
